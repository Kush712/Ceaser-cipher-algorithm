# Ceaser-cipher-algorithm
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. The same shift is used for decryption by moving the letters back to their original positions.
