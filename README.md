# Ceaser-cipher-algorithm
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. The same shift is used for decryption by moving the letters back to their original positions.

The Caesar cipher is a simple and ancient encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it in his private correspondence. The method involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. This means 'X' with a shift of 3 becomes 'A'. The same shift value (key) is used to decrypt the message, reversing the process. Despite its simplicity and historical significance, the Caesar cipher is not secure by modern standards due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks, as there are only 25 possible shifts.
